## From Seed to Success

This guide helps families create a year-round cycle:
1. **Collect** seeds from plants you're already growing
2. **Store** them properly until planting season
3. **Plant** at the right time for your climate
4. **Harvest** and enjoy the results
5. **Collect** seeds again to continue the cycle

**Remember:** Every expert gardener started with their first seed. The most important thing is to begin, observe, and learn from your plants!
