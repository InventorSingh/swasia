          In our search for inspiration, the name <strong>Sia</strong> emerged — meaning victory, blessing, and grace. 
          These qualities perfectly embody our mission: victory in bringing nature back to cities, 
          the blessing of clean air, and the grace of sustainable urban living through innovative treehouse designs.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
          Swasia combines Sia's spirit with our vision for urban transformation. Through our treehouses, 
          we're creating living laboratories that demonstrate how nature can thrive in city spaces. 
          Each treehouse is a testament to our belief that every child deserves to grow up in a world 
          where clean air and green spaces are fundamental rights, not luxuries.

          breathing clean air, under the shade of trees."
