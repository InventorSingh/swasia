“May the nature be with you.”
Dedicated to my daughter, Sia — and to every child who deserves to grow up breathing clean
air, under the shade of trees.
1. What is Swasia?
Swasia is a movement to bring nature back into our cities — starting with something as
magical and simple as a treehouse. These aren’t just any treehouses. They’re living,
breathing climate labs — built in urban areas to show how trees can cool our surroundings,
clean our air, and reconnect people with the natural world.
Swasia stands at the crossroads of architecture, ecology, and technology — using treehouses
to prove a powerful idea: Nature doesn’t need to be kept outside our cities. Nature is the city.
2. The Heart of Swasia: Sia
When we were looking for a name for our daughter, we turned to AI for inspiration. Among the
names were Kalki, a symbol of powerful change, and Kayra, a name that brings peace. But
one name stood out: Sia — meaning victory, blessing, and grace.
Swasia is her legacy — a project that carries the spirit of her name forward. It’s for her, and
every child like her, who deserves to grow up in a world where clean air and green space
aren’t luxuries — they’re rights.
3. Our Mission
To build treehouses in urban areas that clean the air, lower the local temperature, gather
real-time environmental data, and become learning and healing spaces for communities.
4. What We’re Building
Each Swasia Treehouse will be built around existing trees or within microforests, use
sustainable, child-safe, and recycled materials, include environmental sensors to measure air
quality, cooling effects, and biodiversity indicators, serve as public learning spaces, and offer
a real-time community dashboard.
5. Why It Matters
Cities are getting hotter every year — heatwaves are deadly. Urban green cover is
disappearing. Children spend less time outdoors than prisoners. Swasia’s purpose is to bring
nature back to where people live — and to show, with data and experience, that this isn’t just
good for the planet, it’s essential for our health, happiness, and future.
6. Our First Step
The first Swasia Treehouse will be built in Uchana, Haryana, India. For this special beginning,
we will plant the sacred Triveni — Peepal, Bargad, and Neem — around the treehouse. This
combination of trees is deeply rooted in Indian tradition, known for providing unmatched
shade, oxygen, and healing benefits. It will be a space where children can climb, breathe,
learn, and dream.
This first site will also gather air and temperature data to show the measurable benefits of
even small patches of nature in urban spaces.
7. Who We’re Partnering With
Swasia invites collaboration from environmental NGOs, urban planners, smart city teams,
schools, and communities. Together, we’re creating something that belongs to everyone —
and grows with every hand that touches it.
8. Long-Term Vision
By 2030, we aim to build 100+ Swasia Treehouses, create a global air quality dashboard, turn
each site into a climate education hub, and influence policy through real-world data.
9. How You Can Join Us
You can be part of Swasia in many ways: sponsor a treehouse, share your skills, support the
mission, bring Swasia to your community, or simply spread the word. Every treehouse starts
with a single seed. You could be the one who plants it.
10. A Note from Gurprit
When my daughter Sia grows up and asks me, “What did you do when the world was
changing?”, I want to point to the trees. To the spaces we built with care. To the data that
helped us breathe easier. To the children laughing in the shade of something we left behind
— not in the past, but for the future.
Swasia is that promise. And this is just the beginning.
